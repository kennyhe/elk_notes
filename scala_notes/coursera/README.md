## Code Examples and Exercises
This is a normal sbt project generated from Scala3 template ([scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md)).

It tracks my coding exercises of [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-functional-programming/home/welcome) course.

### Usage

You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

Run test cases with `sbt test`.
